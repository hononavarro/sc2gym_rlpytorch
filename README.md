# Different Deep Reinforcement Approaches For Starcraft 2 Mini-games

In this repo we cover two algorithms for solving different starcraft mini-games.


## DeepQ

* One Ouput Array (current): 0-4095
* Two array coordinates (under development):
* Two matrixes Input, Two matrixes Output: array of [3] [group, coordenates_x, cooredantes_y]


## A2C

* One Ouput Array (current): 0-4095
